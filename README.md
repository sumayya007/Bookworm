online store for used books
The Book Shop is an online medium for “selling old and used books”. The authenticated User can log into their account and view available books for sale, add them to their Wish List or directly message the Seller. There is no third-party involvement here, every dealings are done directly between the users, hence no need of payment or delivery system .The Seller can upload list of books for sale mentioning the book condition and date of posting the Ad among various other details. He can also buy books from other users using the same account .The Admin can log into his secure account with his credentials and view the user details, the seller with their booklist for sale, also the entire books uploaded into the system. He can also send email to users or sellers. This project will be a great blessing for the reading community as everybody will be able to read different books. I have developed this FULL STACK Application using Asp.net  (C#) and Sql Server
